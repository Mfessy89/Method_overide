## Introduction
The program defines two classes:

Adult: Represents an adult individual with attributes like name, age, eye color, and hair color. The class includes a method can_drive() that indicates whether the adult can drive.

Child: Inherits from the Adult class and overrides the can_drive() method to indicate that children cannot drive.
## Usage
This program demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and inheritance in Python. Users can provide input to create instances of either the Adult or Child class, based on the age provided. The can_drive() method of each class is then called to display whether the individual can drive or not.
